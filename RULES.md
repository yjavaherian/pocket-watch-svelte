in this file I list some rules i have created to help organize the UI better.

- the only imports from the page.svelte files should be from the components folder and backend related imports.
- the components should be created from peiceing together UI elements that reside in the ui/ folder.
- the ui elements can only use bits ui components or basic html elements.
